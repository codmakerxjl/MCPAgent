## üéØ Core Value
Security Agent revolutionizes reverse engineering and vulnerability research through LLM-enhanced analysis:
- üß† **AI-Powered RE** - Deep learning-based symbol recovery
- ‚ö° **Hybrid Analysis** - Seamless Windbg/IDA workflow orchestration
- üåê **Multi-LLM Gateway** - Unified interface for DeepSeek/OpenAI/Claude

## üöÄ Key Features
### Cognitive Analysis Engine
- **LLM-Driven Insights**
  - Function signature reconstruction
  - Cross-reference context annotation
  - Pseudocode semantic enrichment
- **Hybrid Execution**
  - Native IDA Python plugin integration
  - Local Windbg session management
  - Real-time analysis state synchronization

### Supported Platforms
- **Dynamic Analysis**
  - **Currently Supported:**  
    - Windows user-mode programs
  - **Planned:**  
    - Other operating systems (e.g., Linux kernel-mode) will be supported in the future.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/security-agent.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration
```python
{
    "OPENAI_CONFIG": {
      "BASE_URL": "https://api.deepseek.com",
      "API_KEY": "Your API Key",
      "MODEL_NAME": "deepseek-chat"
    },
    "MCP_SERVER": [
        {
        "name": "File System Service",
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "./sample_files"],
        "files_path": "./sample_files"
        }
    ],

    "AGENT_CONFIG": {
      "name": "Security Intelligence Expert",
      "instructions": "You are a professional computer security expert. You can use tools and answer user questions."
    }
  }
  ```
## üí° Usage Examples

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- The current agent's chat window is limited to the current session and does **not** remember conversations from previous sessions.
- Dynamic analysis is **not yet fully developed**.

## üöÄ Next-Generation Roadmap

Planned features for future releases include:

1. **Improved Multi-Turn Conversation Memory**  
   Enable large models to retain and recall conversation history across multiple sessions, enhancing context continuity.

2. **Multi-Platform Compatibility & Advanced Debugging Capabilities**  
   Allow the agent to run seamlessly on various operating systems and provide more powerful debugging and analysis tools for large models.

3. **End-to-End Fuzzing Analysis Support**  
   Integrate large models into the entire fuzzing workflow, from mutation guidance and crash generation to automated root cause analysis.

4. **Automated GUI Bypass and Harness Generation**  
   Empower large models to bypass GUI program interfaces and automatically generate testing harnesses for automation.

5. **Self-Evolution Based on Tool Functionality and Documentation**  
   Enable large models to evolve autonomously by understanding tool features and development documentation, continuously adapting to and optimizing for specific toolchains.
